# ü§ñ AI Algorithms Collection

This repository is a collection of classical Artificial Intelligence algorithms implemented in Python and Prolog. It's designed for learning and demonstration purposes, showcasing various problem-solving approaches in AI such as search strategies, game playing, heuristics, expert systems, and production systems.

## üìÅ Contents

### Python Implementations
- `4_queens.py` ‚Äì N-Queens problem using backtracking
- `bfs.py` ‚Äì Breadth-First Search
- `dfs.py` ‚Äì Depth-First Search
- `dijkstra.py` ‚Äì Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path algorithm
- `8_puzzle.py` ‚Äì 8 Puzzle Solver using heuristic (A* or similar)
- `alpha_beta.py` ‚Äì Alpha-Beta Pruning for game tree search
- `tictactoe_minmax.py` ‚Äì Tic Tac Toe game with Minimax AI
- `tsp.py` ‚Äì Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using heuristics

### Prolog Implementations
- `books.pl` ‚Äì Production system for book classification
- `disease.pl` ‚Äì Expert system for disease diagnosis
